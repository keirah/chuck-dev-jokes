This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [Reason Scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts).

To get started with using ReasonReact, first install the [Reason-cli tools](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/global-installation.html) and [bs-platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform).

Then run `yarn start`.

The app should open and be viewable at `http://localhost:3000/`.

Thanks to [jsdf](https://github.com/jsdf/github-reason-react-tutorial) for his great [ReasonReact tutorial](https://jamesfriend.com.au/a-first-reason-react-app-for-js-developers).
